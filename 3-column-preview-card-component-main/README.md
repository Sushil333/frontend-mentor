## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned flex-box and grid. These are css attributes that make life so much easier, if you want to align or arrange element in certain way.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="group-card">
  <div class="card">...</div>
  <div class="card">...</div>
  <div class="card">...</div>
</h1>
```
```css
.group-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;  
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;   /* For bottom radius */
}
```
